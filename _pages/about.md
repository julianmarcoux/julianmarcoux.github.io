About me 
======
Welcome ! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Lausane (HEC)](), under the supervision of [Mathias Thoenig]() and [Mathieu Couttenier](). My research use tools from the **quantitative spatial economics** and **international economics** to study **development** and **political** economy questions, notably related to **conflicts** and **development**. 

New ! 
======
We are happy to announce the launch of the Lausanne Theory for Applied Micro Reading Group and Seminar, which I co-founded and co-organize together with [Geoffrey Hilton](https://geoffreyhilton.github.io/). Learn more about it [here]() !
