About me 
-------------
Welcome ! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Lausane (HEC)](), under the supervision of Pr. [Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/) and Pr. [Mathieu Couttenier](https://sites.google.com/site/coutteniermathieu/). My research applies quantitative spatial and international economics tools to study development and political economy, focusing on conflicts, geoeconomics, and development questions.
