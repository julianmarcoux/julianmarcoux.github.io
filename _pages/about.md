About me 
-------------
Welcome ! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Lausane (HEC)](), under the supervision of Pr. [Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/) and Pr. [Mathieu Couttenier](https://sites.google.com/site/coutteniermathieu/). My research use tools from **quantitative spatial economics** and **international economics** to explore questions in **development** and **political** economy, with a particular focus on **conflicts**, **geoeconomics** and **development**. 

News  
-------------
We are excited to announce the launch of the Lausanne Theory for Applied Micro Reading Group and Seminar, which I co-founded and co-organize with [Geoffrey Hilton](https://geoffreyhilton.github.io/). Learn more about it [here](https://julianmarcoux.github.io/reading_group/) !
