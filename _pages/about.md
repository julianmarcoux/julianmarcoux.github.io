About me 
-------------
Welcome ! I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Lausane (HEC)](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Mathias Thoenig](https://people.unil.ch/mathiasthoenig/), Prof. [Aur√©lien Eyquem](http://aeyq.free.fr/) and Prof. [Mathieu Couttenier](https://sites.google.com/site/coutteniermathieu/).

I specialize in international economics and quantitative spatial economics. More specifically, my research applies tools from these fields to study development and political economy, focusing mainly on conflicts, geoeconomics, and national security.
