About the LTAM
=========

This reading group is tailored for PhD students interested in research using economic theory to answer empirical questions. This might mean pure theory, applied theory, structural, or even theoretically-motivated reduced form work. Some examples include contract theory or quantitative spatial economics for development economics and structural models for political economy. 
Each week, for one hour, PhD students discuss a paper or one or two PhD students presents their research. Post-doctoral fellows and faculty are more then welcomed and often joined. 
In addition to giving students working on applied micro topics the opportunity to present, the goal of LTAM is to help everyone come up with research topics, learn more about models that can help them improve their empirical research, and generally improve their theoretical literacy and skills. 
Finally, the reading group is also held on Zoom to allow external PhD students to join and participate, which is greatly encouraged.

The LTAM is happy to join the Rare Voices Micro Research Cluster Seminar
=========

Once per month, the LTAM joins the [Rare Voices Micro Research Cluster Seminar] to attend presentations by PhD students from the [University of Lausanne], the [University of Geneva], and the [Graduate Institute]. 
For 1.5 hours, one or two PhD students present their research in a seminar-style setting and receive feedback.
