About the LTAM
------------

This reading group is tailored for PhD students interested in research using economic theory to answer empirical questions. This may include pure theory, applied theory, structural work, or even theoretically-motivated reduced form approaches. Some examples include contract theory or quantitative spatial economics for development economics and structural models for political economy. 

For one hour, PhD students discuss a paper or one or two PhD students presents their research. Post-doctoral fellows and faculty often joined.
