During my PhD, I participated in the creation and organization of several research events.

1st Lausanne PhD Macro Conference
------------
The conference took place on **December 4–5, 2025**, in Lausanne. The conference featured **12 PhD presentations**, each followed by a discussion, covering a wide range of topics in macroeconomics. We had the opportunity to host two keynote speakers: Professor Matteo Maggiori and Carlos Thomas.  
The program can be found [here](/files/pdf/Programme_UnilPhDConferenceMacro.pdf).

Lausanne Theory for Applied Micro Reading Group (LTAM)
------------
Together with Geoffrey Hilton, I co-founded the Lausanne Theory for Applied Micro (LTAM) reading group. This reading group is aimed at PhD students interested in research that uses economic theory to address empirical questions.  
The reading group now has a website: [LTAM website](https://sites.google.com/view/lausanne-theory-applied-micro/ltam).
